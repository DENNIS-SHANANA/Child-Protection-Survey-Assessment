This project evaluates child protection awareness, practices, and perceptions among child protection promoters within the community, using data collected through face-to-face interviews and Kobo Collect. Its importance lies in identifying gaps and challenges in existing child protection measures, thus providing actionable recommendations to enhance the safety and well-being of children. By informing policies, training programs, and community initiatives, the project aims to strengthen the protection of children's rights and foster a more secure environment for their growth and development.
